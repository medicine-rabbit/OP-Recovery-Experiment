# Workflows Directory

This directory contains operational workflows that support the execution of experimental activities.

## Structure

Workflows are organized by activity family (e.g., `/bikeerg_base/`), and contain step-by-step procedures to ensure correct setup, data capture, and physiological-mechanical fusion during training.

Each workflow is linked to one or more specifications through the `workflow_dependencies` field.

## Purpose

Workflows ensure consistency and minimize error during experimental sessions by standardizing setup and execution procedures across devices and systems.

They are modular, version-controlled, and can evolve independently from activity specifications.
