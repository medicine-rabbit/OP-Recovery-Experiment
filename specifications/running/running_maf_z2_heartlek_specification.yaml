  name: MAF_Run_Z2_Heartlek
  code: R-MAF001
  version: 1.0
  description: |
    Combined base run structure consisting of:
    (1) a fixed-distance MAF test at ~75% HRmax, followed by
    (2) an open-ended Zone 2 heartlek (free running with HR kept below ~80% HRmax).
    Used for aerobic base development, substrate crossover training, and ventilatory control.

  structure:
    - phase: MAF_Test
      distance_km: 5.0  # or adjust per cycle
      target_hr_bpm: 127
      acceptable_hr_drift_bpm: 2  # allowable increase across splits
      completion_criteria:
        - maintain HR within target ±3 bpm
        - no excessive drift (>2 bpm split-to-split unless environmental factors logged)
        - no fatigue event post-run (or event is mild and resolves with simple mitigation)
    - phase: Z2_Heartlek
      distance_km: variable
      target_hr_ceiling_bpm: 137
      progression_criteria:
        - no delayed fatigue within 3–4 hr post-session
        - perceived effort stays low (RPE ≤ 3/10)
        - aerobic markers improving (e.g., lower HR at faster pace, stable cadence)
        - soreness < mild by next morning
        - maintain mechanical form (cadence and rSFR in acceptable range)

  progression_logic:
    - Only progress Heartlek distance if:
      - No next-day soreness (or "very mild" and fully resolving within 24 hr)
      - No fatigue event triggered post-run
      - Average pace during Heartlek stable or improving slightly
      - No significant HR drift (>5 bpm increase without pace acceleration)
    - Progression method:
      - Add +0.5 to +1.0 km to Heartlek when criteria met
      - Re-assess after each addition; regress if fatigue or dysfunction detected

  event_linkage_policy:
    - Log any fatigue, glycemic, or cognitive disruption events separately
    - Reference event IDs in post_training_events field of session log

  special_considerations:
    - If training in heat (>22°C) or humidity (>70%), adjust MAF HR upwards by ~5 bpm
    - Fasted runs allowed but must be tagged `MAF_fasted` and event susceptibility monitored
    - Post-run carbohydrate replenishment advised if signs of substrate fatigue observed
