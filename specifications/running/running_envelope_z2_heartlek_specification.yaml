  code: R-ENV001
  version: 1.0
  description: |
    Fixed-power aerobic run protocol based on maintaining mechanical power output
    equivalent to Day 1 MAF test. Designed to improve mechanical economy at a set metabolic cost.
    Followed by an optional Zone 2 Heartlek for aerobic system reinforcement.
    Core focus is on mechanical efficiency expansion at known sub-threshold power outputs.

  structure:
    - phase: Envelope_Run
      distance_km: 5.0  # initially matching MAF test distance
      target_power_watts: {{maf_day1_garmin_avg_power}}
      acceptable_power_drift_watts: ±5  # Allowable deviation
      completion_criteria:
        - maintain average Garmin power within ±5 watts of target
        - minimize HR drift across splits (<5 bpm preferred)
        - Adjust running form to get instantaneous Stryd power closer to Garmin power.

    - phase: Z2_Heartlek
      distance_km: variable
      target_hr_ceiling_bpm: 137
      progression_criteria:
        - no post-run fatigue event
        - no next-day soreness beyond very mild
        - maintain or slightly improve avg pace at same HR

  progression_logic:
    - Progress Envelope_Run distance only if:
      - Avg pace at target power improves by ≥1% across two sessions
      - No significant HR drift
    - Progress Heartlek distance gradually (0.5–1.0 km increments) if recovery and system stress metrics allow

  event_linkage_policy:
    - Log any fatigue, neuromuscular disruption, or glycemic events separately
    - Reference event IDs in post_training_events field

  special_considerations:
    - If training in heat (>22°C) or high humidity (>70%), document conditions but do not adjust target power
    - Fasted envelope runs are discouraged unless experimental; require separate tagging if done
    - Post-run carbohydrate replenishment recommended if fatigue signals observed
