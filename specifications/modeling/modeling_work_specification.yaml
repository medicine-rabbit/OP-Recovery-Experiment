specification_name: Open-Ended Modeling Work
description: |
  Cognitive modeling sessions aimed at constructing, refining, or expanding Adaptive Systems Physiology models, protocols, or structures.

fusion_requirement:
  fusion_required: false
  notes: |
    No fusion monitoring needed. Success criteria are knowledge structure emergence and sustained cognitive load.

pathway_targets:
  - BDNF+
  - CREB+
  - Wnt/Î²-catenin+
  - Executive Function Resilience+

stimulus_characteristics:
  cognitive_complexity: high
  emotional_valence: neutral-positive (focused engagement)
  duration_unit: minutes
  recommended_minimum_duration: 30  # Minutes for sufficient BDNF/CREB activation
  recommended_maximum_duration: 150 # Avoid cognitive fatigue

logging_requirements:
  fields_to_log:
    - start_time
    - end_time
    - total_duration_minutes
    - task_focus (e.g., "Fusion Specification Draft", "GOMS YAML Mapping", etc.)

perceptron_integration:
  stimulus_time_credit:
    - BDNF: total_duration_minutes
    - CREB: total_duration_minutes
    - Executive_Function: total_duration_minutes
  activation_multiplier: 1.0
  notes: |
    Each minute of open-ended modeling counts fully toward pathway stimulus time tracking.
