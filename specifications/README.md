# Specifications Directory

This directory contains structured specifications and workflows for the OP Recovery Experiment.

## Structure

- `/bikeerg/`  
  Specifications for BikeErg sessions, including base rides, interval rides, and sprint training.

- `/running/`  
  Specifications for running activities, including base runs, aerobic strides, and sprint phases.

- `/owl/`  
  Specifications for Olympic Weightlifting (OWL) sessions, including lift templates and fatigue models.

- `/modeling/`  
  Specifications for physiological modeling activities, including adaptive system modeling and data collection protocols.

- `/workflows/`  
  Operational workflows linked to specific activities (e.g., pre-ride setup for BikeErg sessions).

## Purpose

Each specification defines the structure, parameters, and tracking requirements for a category of experimental activities.  
Workflows ensure operational fusion between biological, mechanical, and cognitive systems during execution.

Specifications and workflows are modular and version-controlled to enable adaptive evolution of the experimental protocol over time.
