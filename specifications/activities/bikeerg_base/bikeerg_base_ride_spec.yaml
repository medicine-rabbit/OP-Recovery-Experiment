specification:
  name: bikeerg_base_ride
  description: >
    Base aerobic BikeErg sessions targeting Zone 2 mitochondrial efficiency,
    AMPK activation, and aerobic cardiac improvement (ACI↑).
    Includes short intervals with steady-state Zone 2 pacing and controlled rest periods.

version: 1.0
notes: >
  This specification governs BikeErg aerobic rides focused on recovery, mitochondrial maintenance,
  and progressive density loading. Future sessions may extend to 3x10:00, 2x15:00, or continuous
  30:00 Zone 2 rides as capacity increases.
