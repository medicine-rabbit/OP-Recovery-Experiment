# File: metrics/sfr_equations.yaml
# Purpose: Define all active Stimulus-to-Fatigue Ratio (SFR) equations used in Adaptive Systems Physiology logs

version: v0.1
description: >
  These equations quantify the ratio between adaptive stimulus and physiological fatigue cost.
  Use the appropriate SFR key in session logs (e.g., SFR[STRIDE]) and reference this file.

models:

  SFR[STRIDE]:
    equation: "avg_stride_time_sec / avg_stride_rss"
    units: "s/RSS"
    notes: >
      Used for short aerobic strides.

  SFR[LACTATE+]:
    equation: "total_recovery_time_sec/recovery_rss"
    units: "s/RSS"
    notes: >
      Used for lactate tolerance or clearance after high-intensity splits.

  SFR[RUN]:
    equation: "effective_zone_2_time_min / RSS"
    units: "min/RSS"
    notes: >
      Generalized run stimulus model for base runs. Effective zone 2 time is considered time not punctuated by heart
      rate spikes greater than zone 3, where zone 2 time is greater than 20 minutes.

  SFR[OWL]:
    equation: "sqrt(total_volume) / EPOC"
    units: "kg/unitless"
    notes: >
      Weightlifting stimulus model. Volume load is total kg lifted; EPOC is calculated by Garmin.
      Useful for tracking diminishing returns from volume in Olympic lifts and accessory work.

  SFR[RECOVERY]:
    equation: "hrv_change_ms / recovery_duration_min"
    units: "ms/min"
    notes: >
      Used to assess recovery sessions.
