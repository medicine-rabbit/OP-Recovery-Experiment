# File: metrics/stride_metrics.yaml
# Purpose: Define metrics tracked per stride effort in aerobic strides protocol

version: v1.0
description: >
  These metrics are logged for each individual stride in aerobic strides sessions.
  They are used to calculate SFR[STRIDE], LCR trends, error deltas, and neuromuscular efficiency.

fields:

  stride_index:
    type: integer
    description: Index number of the stride within the session
    example: 8

  time:
    type: float
    units: sec
    description: Duration of the stride effort in seconds
    example: 12.0

  max_pace:
    type: pace
    units: min/km
    description: Peak pace achieved during the stride
    example: "2:33"

  avg_pace:
    type: pace
    units: min/km
    description: Average pace over the stride duration
    example: "3:20"

  garmin_power:
    type: integer
    units: W
    description: Power output recorded by Garmin HRM-Pro; tracks total power output
    example: 384

  stryd_power:
    type: integer
    units: W
    description: Power output recorded by Stryd footpod; tracks only mechanical power output
    example: 360

  recovery_hr:
    type: integer
    units: bpm
    description: Heart rate at the end of the recovery walk following the stride, triggering a new stride (bottom threshold to peak_hr as the top threshold)
    example: 114

  recovery_time:
    type: float
    units: sec
    description: Time from stride end to the beginning of the next stride (i.e., walk duration)
    example: 171

  peak_hr:
    type: integer
    units: bpm
    description: Peak heart rate immediately following the stride
    example: 154

  lactate_clearance_rate:
    type: float
    units: delta_bpm/sec
    description: Change in HR divided by recovery time (ΔHR / recovery_time), estimating lactate clearance
    example: 0.255

  lcr_error:
    type: float
    units: delta
    description: Difference between goal LCR and actual LCR (goal_lcr - lcr)
    example: 0.353

  hr_peak_error:
    type: integer
    units: bpm
    description: Difference between actual peak HR and target zone max
    example: 5

  speed_error:
    type: float
    units: sec
    description: Difference between target stride time and actual stride time
    example: 2.0

  stride_rss:
    type: float
    units: unitless
    description: Relative Stride Stress score—session-specific training stress from this stride. Calculated by Stryd.
    example: 1.0
