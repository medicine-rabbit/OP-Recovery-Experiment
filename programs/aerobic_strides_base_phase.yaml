program_name: Aerobic Strides Base Phase
specification_reference: specifications/aerobic_strides_specification.yaml
description: |
  Adaptive aerobic neuromuscular conditioning phase using structured aerobic strides.
  Progression between stride distances is based on physiological conditions, not preset calendar weeks.

phases:
  - phase_name: 60m Strides Phase
    stride_distance_meters: 60
    initial_stride_sets: 5
    target_stride_duration_seconds: 9
    post_stride_hr_zone_target: Z3
    progression_conditions:
      - All post_stride_hr_spike values during a session must remain within Zone 3.
      - Average stride duration must be less than or equal to 9 seconds.
    notes: |
      Phase cannot progress to 80m until both HR zone and stride time targets are satisfied.
      Targets may be eased if needed during pre-experiment adaptation phase.
    post_session_intervention:
      type: NSDR
      timing_minutes_after_session: 60
      duration_minutes: 10-20
      reasoning: |
        NSDR may maintain BDNF and CREB activity during the plasticity window following aerobic stimulation.

  - phase_name: 80m Strides Phase
    stride_distance_meters: 80
    initial_stride_sets: 5
    target_stride_duration_seconds: 12
    post_stride_hr_zone_target: Z3
    progression_conditions:
      - All post_stride_hr_spike values during a session must remain within Zone 3.
      - Average stride duration must be less than or equal to 12 seconds.
    notes: |
      Phase cannot progress to 100m until both HR zone and stride time targets are satisfied.

  - phase_name: 100m Strides Phase
    stride_distance_meters: 100
    initial_stride_sets: 5
    target_stride_duration_seconds: 15
    post_stride_hr_zone_target: Z3
    progression_conditions:
      - All post_stride_hr_spike values during a session must remain within Zone 3.
      - Average stride duration must be less than or equal to 15 seconds.
    notes: |
      Final aerobic strides phase before transition to anaerobic development.

# Simple NSDR Protocol (for protocols/nsdr_simple.yaml)

protocol_name: NSDR Simple Recovery
protocol_type: NSDR
applicable_after: Aerobic Strides, Dual-Signal Days, or Cognitive Load Sessions
description: |
  Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) protocol designed to extend neuroplasticity consolidation following aerobic and neuromuscular training.
steps:
  - Find a quiet, dark space.
  - Lay down comfortably with minimal external stimulation.
  - Set a timer for 10 to 20 minutes.
  - Perform relaxed breathing without guided visualization, or use a simple body scan technique.
  - Goal is to enter a parasympathetic-dominant state without falling fully asleep.
notes: |
  NSDR may help sustain BDNF and CREB activation, support emotional regulation, and accelerate recovery after training.
