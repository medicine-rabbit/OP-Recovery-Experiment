program_name: Aerobic Strides Base Phase
specification_reference: aerobic_strides_specification.yaml
description: |
  Adaptive aerobic neuromuscular conditioning phase using structured aerobic strides.
  Progression based on physiological conditions, not preset calendar weeks.

phases:
  - phase_name: 60m Strides Phase
    stride_distance_meters: 60
    initial_stride_sets: 5
    target_stride_duration_seconds: 9
    post_stride_hr_zone_target: Z3
    progression_conditions:
      - all post_stride_hr_spike values during a session must remain within Z3
      - average_stride_duration_seconds must be ≤ 9 seconds
    notes: |
      Phase cannot progress to 80m until both HR zone and stride time targets are satisfied.
      Targets may be eased if recovery or base condition requires adjustment.
    post_session_intervention:
      type: NSDR
      timing_minutes_after_session: 60
      duration_minutes: 10-20
      reasoning: "NSDR may maintain BDNF and CREB activity during the plasticity window."

  - phase_name: 80m Strides Phase
    stride_distance_meters: 80
    initial_stride_sets: 5
    target_stride_duration_seconds: 12
    post_stride_hr_zone_target: Z3
    progression_conditions:
      - all post_stride_hr_spike values during a session must remain within Z3
      - average_stride_duration_seconds must be ≤ 12 seconds
    notes: |
      Phase cannot progress to 100m until both HR zone and stride time targets are satisfied.

  - phase_name: 100m Strides Phase
    stride_distance_meters: 100
    initial_stride_sets: 5
    target_stride_duration_seconds: 15
    post_stride_hr_zone_target: Z3
    progression_conditions:
      - all post_stride_hr_spike values during a session must remain within Z3
      - average_stride_duration_seconds must be ≤ 15 seconds
    notes: |
      Final aerobic strides phase before transition to anaerobic development.
