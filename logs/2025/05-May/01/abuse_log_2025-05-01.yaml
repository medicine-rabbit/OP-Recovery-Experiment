summary: >
  This letter failed to respond to any allegations or to restore my ER access Asheville VA illegally withholds by sending lies to area hospitals denying my immune deficiency and explaining away the topiramate reactions as "atopic dermatitis", which I do not have. Similarly, they lied in my records to indicate I was "diagnosed with asthma as a child", which is a lie, to explain the topiramate TEN effect in lungs, ears, etc.

  I am logging it formally
  for inclusion in the OP Recovery dataset, evidence archive, and possible submission to oversight bodies.
