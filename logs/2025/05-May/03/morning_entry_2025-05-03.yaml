grip: 53.4 # kg
REM: 61 # min
HRV: 32 # ms
mood: "stable"

animal_interaction:
  pet: Hito
  location: bed
  duration: ~03:45
  effect_on_sleep:
    latency: decreased (still over 1h)
    REM: possibly improved
  notes: "Hito (cat) remained on bed until around 03:45; presence may have reduced hypervigilance and supported limbic calm."

notes:
  - "0.3 kg increase in grip strenth, slight rebound in HRV (though still below my baseline), and increased REM sleep indicate recovery ride had some effect."
  - "Increased REM may be attributed to stopping 5-HTP and L-trytophan two days ago."
  - "Increased REM may also be attributed to cat sleeping on bed."
