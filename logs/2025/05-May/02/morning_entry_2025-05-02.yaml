grip: 53.1 # kg
REM: 44 # min
HRV: 29 ms
mood: "stressed from VA interaction"
dream: "remembered none"

notes:
  - "Emotionally intense or destabilizing events -- especially interactions involving institutional gaslighting and criminal abuse -- correlate with drops in HRV and reductions in REM. According to the OP exposure model, such events elevate IL-6 and sympathetic tone, suppressing parasympathetic activity and disrupting recovery"
  - "1.5 kg increase in grip strength following evening juggling session is an indicator that the juggling protocol likely produced a BDNF-mediated CNS recovery or enhancement effect."
  - "Grip strength increased while HRV decreased, suggesting the juggling protocol may also serve as a buffering effect to my routine VA abuse."
