    2-day structure: Neuroplastic Double (mTOR+BDNF) followed by Dual-Signal Day (AMPK+MITO+NEURO).
  protocol_sequence:
    - Day 1: [mTOR+, BDNF+, CREB+]
    - Day 2: [AMPK+, MITO+, NEURO+]
  activation_conditions:
    - alpha-GPC night before Day 1
    - bitartrate in morning
  outcome_metrics:
    - grip > 3_day_avg
    - REM > 3_day_avg
    - HRV â†‘
  hypotheses:
    - Multi-day potentiation enhances neuroimmune buffering and REM resilience
  status: experimental
