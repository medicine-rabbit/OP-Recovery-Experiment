Pattern:
  name: Midday Alpha-GPC
  type: antipattern
  description: >
    Administering alpha-GPC too early leads to potential circadian misalignment and REM suppression
  trigger_conditions:
    - alpha-GPC taken between 11:00–14:00
  observed_effects:
    - REM ↓
    - RHR ↑
    - rumination ↑
  countermeasures:
    - shift alpha-GPC to 30–60 min pre-bed
  hypotheses:
    - Midday ACh surge narrows REM window and increases verbal loop activation
  status: under review
