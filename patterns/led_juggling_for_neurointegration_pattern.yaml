    Sensorimotor-juggling with peripheral blue light for BDNF+ and REM enhancement
  protocol:
    - inputs: [blue LED, 3-ball cascade, 432Hz music]
    - activity: juggling
    - timing: 15 minutes pre-bed or post-run
  mechanism_tags:
    - BDNF+
    - CREB+
  measurable_effects:
    - REM rebound
    - grip increase
    - ruminative loop reduction
  hypotheses:
    - Peripheral photic stimulation enhances sensory integration and REM initiation
  status: confirmed
